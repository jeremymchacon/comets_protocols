# comets_protocols

In this repo are ipynb notebooks which demonstrate how to use COMETS to do a handful of things useful in the Harcombe lab. Look in the subdirectories for ipynb files, and clicking on them in github should show the whole protocol. 

The main thing is showing how to use our 3-species mutualism, in well-mixed or spatial sims. 

Another thing is showing how to use signaling to attempt having phage be part of a COMETS sim.
